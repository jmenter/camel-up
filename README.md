iOS app that simulates the game Camel-Up

Tap the dice to add and remove them from the pyramid. Tap and drag a camel to move it. Tap a square to cycle through trap types (+1, -1, or nothing.)

You can do a single camel move, a whole leg, or a whole race. Whenever the game state changes, it goes through anywhere from 100 to 2000 simulations to guess who the winning camels might be and what the expected value of grabbing a token is.
